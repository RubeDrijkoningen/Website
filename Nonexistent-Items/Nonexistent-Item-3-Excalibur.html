                Excalibur – Legendary Sword, Casually Found in a Rock<br><br>
                Ready to become the ruler of your backyard? Look no further, because we present to you: Excalibur – the legendary sword of King Arthur… or at least something that really looks like it.
                We found this masterpiece just chilling in a rock near the parking lot. No angelic chorus, no lightning bolt, no ancient guardians. Just some moss, a rusty nail, and a construction worker with a crowbar. And now – it's yours, for a bargain price!<br><br>
                Specifications:<br><br>
                Material: Metal-ish. Sturdy enough to impress friends, not guaranteed against dragons.<br><br>
                Historical authenticity: 0% confirmed, 100% suspected.<br><br>
                Magical powers: Not currently activated (try under a full moon).<br><br>
                Includes: The rock? Nope. Too heavy.<br><br>
                Disclaimer: Not suitable for actual kingship, medieval battles, or summoning ancient wizards.
