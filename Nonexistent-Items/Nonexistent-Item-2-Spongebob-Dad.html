                <h1>SpongeBob’s Dad – Sentient Meatball with a Mustache</h1><br><br>
                Ever wanted a father figure that looks like a confused potato and sounds like he pays taxes in sea shells?
                SpongeBob’s Dad is here – the only entity that makes less sense than your childhood.
                We found him wandering the seafood aisle, muttering something about "back in my tide." He asked for butterscotch. We gave him a listing.<br><br>
                Specifications:<br><br>
                Species: Ambiguous. Possibly legume-based.<br><br>
                Eyes: Always judging. Even when closed.<br><br>
                Voice: 84% nostalgia, 16% phlegm.<br><br>
                Includes: Suspenders. Regret.<br><br>
                Disclaimer: May remind you of long car rides, unexplained wisdom, and oddly specific advice. Not suitable for identifying family resemblances or emotional growth.
