                Quagmire – Giggity-Powered Chaos in Human Form<br><br>
                Smooth-talking. Questionably employed. Legally confusing.
                Quagmire is here – a living paradox of charm, chaos, and deeply unasked-for energy.
                We didn’t mean to add him to the catalog. He just kind of showed up. And stayed. Now he’s your problem.<br><br>
                Specifications:<br><br>
                Personality: 97% giggity, 3% lawsuit.<br><br>
                Profession: Pilot? Neighbor? Disturbance.<br><br>
                Energy source: Mustache oil and sheer libido.<br><br>
                Includes: Two thumbs up. No shame. Zero boundaries.<br><br>
                Disclaimer: Not safe for work, family, or really… anywhere. May spontaneously narrate his own life. Handle with holy water and a firm “No.”
