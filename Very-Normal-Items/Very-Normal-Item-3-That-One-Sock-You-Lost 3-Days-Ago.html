                That One Sock You Lost 3 Days Ago – Returned... Changed<br><br>
                It’s back. But not the same. That One Sock went somewhere weird and came back knowing things.
                Now slightly sentient. And slightly damp.<br><br>
                Specifications:<br><br>
                Fabric: Unknown.<br><br>
                Color: Was white. Isn’t now.<br><br>
                Odor: Unplaceable. Profound.<br><br>
                Includes: Silent judgment.<br><br>
                Disclaimer: Do not pair with anything. Do not ask where it’s been.
